### Possible Design

Design a framework to support items in a godot game written in c#
- Items should have an id, name, description, weight, and value
- items are immutable
- Some items are consumable like food and potions.
- Some items are equippable like weapons and armor
- Some items have complex usages like a fishing rod
- Some items are not usable at all
- Some items are unique
- Some items can be destroyed and some can't
- some items can be crafted and some can't
- some items can be stacked x amount of times and some can't
